## Key Achievements

### Week 1-2
- High-performance agent system (<3μs instantiation)
- Clean interface-based architecture
- Comprehensive testing framework

### Week 3-4
- Multi-agent collaboration (Team)
- Complex workflow orchestration (Workflow)
- 3 LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama)
- 100% test coverage for types package
- KISS principle applied to project scope

---

## Lessons Learned

### KISS Principle Applied (2025-10-01)

**Problems Identified**:
1. Scope creep - trying to match Python's 45+ LLMs and 115+ tools
2. Documentation redundancy - multiple progress reports
3. Uneven test coverage across packages

**Actions Taken**:
1. Reduced scope: 3 core LLMs (not 8)
2. Reduced tools: 5 essential tools (not 15+)
3. Reduced vector DBs: 1 (ChromaDB) for validation
4. Cleaned up documentation (removed 4 redundant files)
5. Improved test coverage (types: 100%, models: 50%+)

**Results**:
- Clearer priorities
- Better code quality
- More maintainable project

## Next Steps

### Short-term (1 week)
1. Performance benchmarks
2. Search tool implementation
3. Model provider code refactoring
4. README update with simplified roadmap

### Medium-term (2-3 weeks)
1. ChromaDB integration
2. Knowledge package
3. RAG example
4. Performance optimization
