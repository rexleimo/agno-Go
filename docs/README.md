# Documentation Index

Agno-Go maintains two documentation surfaces:

- **`website/`** – the VitePress site that ships with the project (Guides, API reference, Advanced topics, Examples, translations). This is the canonical reference for user-facing docs.
- **`docs/`** – internal notes, design proposals, migration plans, and contributor-oriented material. Anything that graduates to a user-facing feature should be promoted to `website/`.

Please avoid duplicating the same content across both locations. Use the tables below to navigate the current internal docs.
