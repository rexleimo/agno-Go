# Agno-Go v1.2.6 Launch Campaign

## Overview

Agno-Go v1.2.6 doubles down on production-readiness by delivering full session parity with the Python runtime, richer media workflows, and an expanded ecosystem of tools and storage adapters. This note collects the long-form announcement and the accompanying social copy so the release team can publish consistently across channels.

> **Title Suggestion:** ‚ÄúAgno-Go v1.2.6: Session Parity, Media Workflows, and Production Tooling‚Äù

Agno-Go v1.2.6 is our biggest runtime release yet. We set out to close the loop between the Go and Python ecosystems, and the new Session Parity layer does exactly that. Every AgentOS deployment now ships with reuse semantics (`POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/reuse`), synchronous and asynchronous summaries, and history filters (`num_messages`, `stream_events`) that mirror the Python runtime. Each run records cache hits, completion states, and cancellation reasons so operations teams can trace outcomes without diffing logs.

To keep latencies low, v1.2.6 introduces a built-in response cache. Flip on `EnableCache` for agents or teams and repeat prompts are deduplicated automatically. Pair it with the new `session.SummaryManager` defaults to keep summaries fresh without sacrificing throughput.

Workflows are getting smarter too. Media attachments flow end-to-end through agents, teams, and workflows thanks to the `WithMediaPayload` helper and validation guards. Resumable checkpoints and persistent cancellation records make it safe to recover long-running jobs, while every attachment remains available to downstream steps and AgentOS integrations.

We also broadened where Agno-Go can run. Postgres was the first-class storage engine, and now MongoDB and SQLite adapters ship alongside it with identical JSON contracts‚Äîperfect for edge deployments or local-first apps. On the tooling side, new integrations drop straight in: Tavily Reader/Search, Claude Agent Skills, Gmail mark-as-read, Jira worklogs, ElevenLabs voice synthesis, enhanced file tooling, and a PPTX reader. All of them plug into the same MCP-friendly toolkit layer you already know.

Finally, documentation got a refresh. The VitePress site now highlights session parity, caching, and media workflows on every locale, and the API guide walks through summary management and reuse flows step-by-step. Head to the updated Guides and API reference to see code snippets for each feature.

**Call to action:**  
Upgrade via `go get github.com/rexleimo/agno-go@v1.2.6`, skim the new session API examples, and let us know how the caching layer affects your workloads.
