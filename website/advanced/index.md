# Advanced Topics

Deep dive into advanced concepts, performance optimization, deployment strategies, and testing best practices for Agno-Go.

## Overview

This section covers advanced topics for developers who want to:

- 🏗️ **Understand the architecture** - Learn the core design principles and patterns
- ⚡ **Optimize performance** - Achieve sub-microsecond agent instantiation
- 🚀 **Deploy to production** - Best practices for production deployments
- 🧪 **Test effectively** - Comprehensive testing strategies and tools

## Core Topics

### [Architecture](/advanced/architecture)

Learn about Agno-Go's modular architecture and design philosophy:

- Core interfaces (Model, Toolkit, Memory)
- Abstraction patterns (Agent, Team, Workflow)
- Go concurrency model integration
- Error handling strategies
- Package organization

**Key concepts**: Clean architecture, dependency injection, interface design

### [Performance](/advanced/performance)

Understand performance characteristics and optimization techniques:

- Agent instantiation (~180ns average)
- Memory footprint (~1.2KB per agent)
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Benchmarking tools and methodologies
- Performance comparison with other frameworks

**Key metrics**: Throughput, latency, memory efficiency, scalability

### [Deployment](/advanced/deployment)

Production deployment strategies and best practices:

- AgentOS HTTP server setup
- Container deployment (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and observability
- Scaling strategies
- Security considerations

**Key technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, distributed tracing

### [Testing](/advanced/testing)

Comprehensive testing approaches for multi-agent systems:

- Unit testing patterns
- Integration testing with mocks
- Performance benchmarking
- Test coverage requirements (>70%)
- CI/CD integration
- Testing tools and utilities

**Key tools**: Go testing, testify, benchmarking, coverage reports

## Quick Links

### Performance Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
make benchmark

# Run specific benchmark
go test -bench=BenchmarkAgentCreation -benchmem ./pkg/agno/agent/

# Generate CPU profile
go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.out ./pkg/agno/agent/
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build AgentOS server
cd pkg/agentos && go build -o agentos

# Run with Docker
docker build -t agno-go-agentos .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY agno-go-agentos
```

### Testing Coverage

Current test coverage by package:

| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| types | 100.0% | ✅ Excellent |
| memory | 93.1% | ✅ Excellent |
| team | 92.3% | ✅ Excellent |
| toolkit | 91.7% | ✅ Excellent |
| workflow | 80.4% | ✅ Good |
| agent | 74.7% | ✅ Good |

## Design Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Agno-Go embraces simplicity:

- **Focused scope**: 3 LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) instead of 8+
- **Essential tools**: 5 core tools instead of 15+
- **Clear abstractions**: Agent, Team, Workflow
- **Minimal dependencies**: Standard library first

### Performance First

Go's concurrency model enables:

- Native goroutine support for parallel execution
- No GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limitations
- Efficient memory management
- Compile-time optimizations

### Production Ready

Built for real-world deployments:

- Comprehensive error handling
- Context-aware cancellation
- Structured logging
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Health checks and metrics
