## Quick Example

Create an AI agent with tools in just a few lines:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/rexleimo/agno-go/pkg/agno/agent"
    "github.com/rexleimo/agno-go/pkg/agno/models/openai"
    "github.com/rexleimo/agno-go/pkg/agno/tools/calculator"
)

func main() {
    // Create model
    model, _ := openai.New("gpt-4o-mini", openai.Config{
        APIKey: "your-api-key",
    })

    // Create agent with tools
    ag, _ := agent.New(agent.Config{
        Name:     "Math Assistant",
        Model:    model,
        Toolkits: []toolkit.Toolkit{calculator.New()},
    })

    // Run agent
    output, _ := ag.Run(context.Background(), "What is 25 * 4 + 15?")
    fmt.Println(output.Content) // Output: 115
}
```

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Python Agno | Agno-Go | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Agent Creation | ~3Î¼s | ~180ns | **16x faster** |
| Memory/Agent | ~6.5KB | ~1.2KB | **5.4x less** |
| Concurrency | GIL limited | Native goroutines | **Unlimited** |

## Why Agno-Go?

### Built for Production

Agno-Go isn't just a frameworkâ€”it's a complete production system. The included **AgentOS** server provides:

- RESTful API with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Session management for multi-turn conversations
- Thread-safe agent registry
- Health monitoring and structured logging
- CORS support and request timeout handling

### KISS Principle

Following the **Keep It Simple, Stupid** philosophy:

- **3 core LLM providers** (not 45+) - OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama
- **Essential tools** (not 115+) - Calculator, HTTP, File, Search
- **Quality over quantity** - Focus on production-ready features

### Developer Experience

- **Type-Safe**: Go's strong typing catches errors at compile time
- **Fast Builds**: Go's compilation speed enables rapid iteration
- **Easy Deployment**: Single binary with no runtime dependencies
- **Great Tooling**: Built-in testing, profiling, and race detection

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/rexleimo/agno-Go.git

# Run example
go run cmd/examples/simple_agent/main.go

# Or start AgentOS server
docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```
